I remember when I was first starting in actuarial science, and having had a physics baccalaureate, when studying for exam P I investigated quantum probability models. I also remember attending seminars a few years ago when interest in InsureTech peaked. So I get the excitement. But what excites isn't necessarily what gets the work done. Take Power BI. Some departments in our company are trying to force ways to use Power BI now because it's trendy, even though there is little room for it in their workflow and it actually reduces productivity due to that.     Avant-garde tech and tried-and-true tech aren't equivalent. For actuarial purposes, one requires some tool to import and/or process data. Then one needs tools to manipulate it, and then something to present it. To a surprisingly broad extent of my business's purposes, Excel seems to work just fine still - at least in the manipulation department. I realize that it's 1990s tech, but it's a lingua franca of sorts throughout the field because of its enduring presence. Sure, you can't look cool to your peers if you're an Excel whiz anymore, but actuarial science isn't cool and isn't supposed to be.     In sum tools that can churn data and push it into formats that Excel can work with are valuable, and they keep the industry standardized.

For example, Akur8 and Emblem are modeling tools being used at various companies across the industry.     Building in-house tools is effective, but not feasible for every carrier. Additionally, the upkeep required is extensive and often an unanticipated cost for insurers. In-house tools also bring forth key-person risk.     As machine learning becomes more popular in the industry, SaaS solutions for actuarial applications will likely become more popular. Even if it is not widely used on this survey, I would anticipate it growing in future years. ",Are you using Software as a Service technologies? Which ones? Why or why not?,"For coding, I think there is a lack of focus on ""code review"" and ""good code."" Actuaries are not computer programmers, and proper code review seems to be a huge hole in the expertise of people who have started coding out of a necessity as opposed to being on a team that is experts in code review. There are many resources for learning R, but as far as I can tell, limited resources for ensuring that all code is reasonability checked and that the assumptions are clear. I would recommend a seminar on ""code review for actuaries.""",FCAS,31-40 years old,United States,,Other (please specify),InsurTech,1-5,Between 5 and 10
